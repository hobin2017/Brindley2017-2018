# PaymentSystem2017
Compared with the last version, the changes are listed below:
1. Both ML Models are replaced by the corresponding simualtion version;
2. The drawback is that I use the same status 'self.reminder_weight_wrong_status' to represents three types error reminder (weigher error, unavailable machine due to the network, more than 4 items are detected.);
